# Vulnerability-Detection-with-Safety-Properties
IT300

Program to implement AFL++ extension "Vulnerability Detection with Safety Properties".

The implement\_patch.py file contains the functions which apply all our additional instrumentations. This includes manipulations to the original source code and daikon.txt declarations file using the Senx bc.patch file. The parser function in implement\_patch.py derives the patch code and location in which to insert the code, then modifies the source file accordingly. This modification includes the creation of a dummy function with parameters representing the interesting variables, referred to as the invariant's left and right side. These parameters will then be notated during the daikon detection process granting the ability to develop customized feedback mechanisms to be instrumented into the binary and used by AFL. The implement\_py file will alter the daikon.txt file to include the the Senx patch, translated into Daikon invariant syntax. This addition to the daikon.txt file is what enables the invariant to be directly inserted as a form of feedback into the final assembly representation of the source code. Inserted within the vulnerable function, a call is made to the the dummy function which checks the status of the variables as instructed to do so by the Senx patch. When this branch is discovered by AFL it is documented in the coverage map and the associated feedback is weighted towards the relationship of the variables which found the edge leading to the specific code block.
